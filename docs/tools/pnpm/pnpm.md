### 通过 npm 安装 pnpm

We provide two packages of pnpm CLI, pnpm and @pnpm/exe.

- pnpm is a ordinary version of pnpm, which needs Node.js to run.

- @pnpm/exe is packaged with Node.js into an executable, so it may be used on a system with no Node.js installed.

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

or

```
npm install -g @pnpm/exe
```
